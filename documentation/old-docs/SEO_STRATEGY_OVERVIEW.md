## Phase 3: SEO Strategy Development (Progress to Date)

### On-Page SEO

*   **Content Optimization:** Keywords to be incorporated naturally.
*   **Homepage Metadata (`src/app/page.tsx` updated):**

**Ensuring E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness):**

*   **Show, Don't Just Tell:**
    *   Share specific examples and (anonymized, if necessary) anecdotes from your experience.
    *   Detail your unique processes (like your "B2B Podcast for Sales system").
*   **Author Bio:** Your founder's experience (Lex Fridman Podcast, etc.) should be highlighted, perhaps in an "About the Founder" section or linked from blog posts. Consider `Person` schema here when you have that content.
*   **Data and Results:** When possible (especially in future case studies), use data to back up your claims about ROI and lead generation.
*   **Professionalism:** A well-designed, error-free website with clear communication contributes to trustworthiness.
*   **Testimonials:** Once you have them, prominently display client testimonials.

**Content Calendar & Consistency (Future Planning):**

*   **Objective:** To maintain a regular publishing schedule for new content (especially blog posts and repurposed video content) to continuously engage the target audience, reinforce expertise, and provide fresh signals for search engines.
*   **Future Development:** This area will require further brainstorming for specific content topics (extending from pillars and clusters) and the development of a structured content calendar (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly posts).
*   **Tools/Approach:** Consider using a simple calendar, a project management tool, or a spreadsheet to plan content titles, target keywords, content types, and publishing dates.
*   **Focus:** Initially, prioritize quality over sheer quantity, focusing on the cornerstone pillar content. As systems develop, a more frequent cadence can be established.

This content strategy provides a roadmap for creating valuable, SEO-friendly content that will attract your ideal clients and position South Lamar Studios as a leader.
