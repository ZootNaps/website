# Image Guidelines for Blog Content

## Recommended Image Dimensions

For optimal display across our website, please follow these image dimension guidelines:

- **Featured/Hero Images**: 1600px × 900px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Blog Post Thumbnails**: 800px × 450px (16:9 aspect ratio)

Maintaining a consistent 16:9 aspect ratio for all images ensures they display properly across our responsive layout.

## Image Preparation Before Upload

1. **Format**: Save images as high-quality JPG files
2. **Compression**: Optimize images before uploading
   - Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
   - Aim for file sizes under 300KB where possible
3. **Remove Metadata**: Strip EXIF data to reduce file size
4. **Color Profile**: Use sRGB color profile for web compatibility
5. **File Naming**: Use descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `company-podcast-interview.jpg`)

## Contentful Best Practices

1. **Always fill in the Title field**: This becomes the image's alt text
2. **Add a Description when relevant**: This may appear as a caption in some layouts
3. **Tag images appropriately**: Use consistent tags to organize assets

## Image Content Guidelines

1. **Relevance**: Ensure images clearly relate to the content
2. **Quality**: Use high-resolution, professionally-shot images
3. **Branding**: Maintain visual consistency with our brand style
4. **Focal Point**: Consider how images will crop on mobile - ensure key elements are centered
5. **Text in Images**: Avoid or minimize text in images as it may be unreadable on small screens

## Image Accessibility

1. **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text via the Title field in Contentful
2. **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background elements
3. **Decorative Images**: If an image is purely decorative, note this in the description
