  "fullTranscript": "# Introduction\n\nGus: Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of Founder Facing. Today I'm excited to be joined by Sarah Johnson, CEO of CloudTech. Sarah, thanks for being here.\n\nSarah: Thanks for having me, Gus. I'm excited to share my story.\n\n# Finding Product-Market Fit\n\nGus: Let's start at the beginning. How did you come up with the idea for CloudTech?\n\nSarah: It actually started when I was working at my previous job. I noticed that companies were struggling with managing their cloud infrastructure efficiently. There were tools out there, but they were either too complex or too simplified. I saw an opportunity to create something that struck the right balance.\n\nGus: And how did you validate that initial idea?\n\nSarah: I talked to probably 100 potential customers before writing a single line of code. The hardest part wasn't building the product; it was figuring out who needed it most and why they would pay for it.\n\n# Building the Team\n\nGus: Tell me about how you built your initial team.\n\nSarah: I knew I needed a technical co-founder since my background was more on the business side. I was fortunate to connect with my co-founder Alex through a mutual friend. He had the technical expertise I lacked, and we complemented each other really well.\n\nGus: What about expanding beyond the founding team?\n\nSarah: We were very deliberate about our first hires. We wanted people who were comfortable with ambiguity and could wear multiple hats. Our first hire was actually a customer success person, not an engineer, because we believed that understanding customer needs was the most critical thing at that stage.\n\n# Funding and Growth\n\nGus: Let's talk about how you funded the business.\n\nSarah: We bootstrapped for the first year, which I think was crucial. It forced us to be capital efficient and really focus on customer needs. After we had paying customers and some traction, we raised a small seed round to accelerate growth.\n\nGus: And I understand you turned down an acquisition offer early on?\n\nSarah: Yes, we turned down our first acquisition offer when we were just 18 months old. Everyone thought we were crazy, but three years later we were worth 10x that amount. Sometimes you have to trust your instincts about the potential of what you're building.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nGus: Any final advice for founders who are just starting their journey?\n\nSarah: Focus on solving a real problem that people will pay for. Everything else follows from that. And surround yourself with people who complement your skills and share your vision but aren't afraid to challenge you.\n\nGus: Sarah, this has been incredibly insightful. Thank you for sharing your journey with us.\n\nSarah: Thanks for having me, Gus. It's been a pleasure."
